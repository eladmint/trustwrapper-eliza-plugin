# ⚠️ CRITICAL SECURITY ADVISORY - TrustWrapper v1.0.0

**Date**: June 25, 2025  
**Severity**: CRITICAL  
**Affected Versions**: 1.0.0  

## Executive Summary

TrustWrapper v1.0.0 contains critical architectural security vulnerabilities that could expose trading strategies and enable front-running attacks. **DO NOT use this version for production trading with real funds.**

## Vulnerabilities Identified

### 1. Pre-Trade Information Disclosure (CRITICAL)
- **Description**: TrustWrapper requires agents to send complete trading decisions BEFORE execution
- **Impact**: Enables front-running, strategy theft, and market manipulation
- **Risk**: Any party with API access can intercept and act on trading information

### 2. Centralized Point of Failure (HIGH)
- **Description**: Single API endpoint processes all agent trading decisions
- **Impact**: If compromised, attacker gains real-time trading intelligence from all agents
- **Risk**: Honeypot for sophisticated trading adversaries

### 3. Weak Authentication (HIGH)
- **Description**: Simple API key authentication with default "demo-key"
- **Impact**: Easily bypassed authentication mechanism
- **Risk**: Unauthorized access to trading data

### 4. No Encryption in Transit (MEDIUM)
- **Description**: HTTP endpoint without TLS encryption
- **Impact**: Trading decisions transmitted in plaintext
- **Risk**: Network-level interception of sensitive data

### 5. Information Aggregation Risk (HIGH)
- **Description**: Service can correlate trading patterns across multiple agents
- **Impact**: Build meta-strategies based on collective agent behavior
- **Risk**: Unfair market advantage through information asymmetry

## Immediate Recommendations

### For Users:
1. **DO NOT** use TrustWrapper for pre-trade verification
2. **DO NOT** send real trading decisions to the API
3. **ONLY** use for post-trade compliance reporting if necessary
4. **ASSUME** all data sent to the service is compromised

### For Developers:
1. **DISABLE** pre-trade verification immediately
2. **IMPLEMENT** local-only verification logic
3. **REMOVE** sensitive data from API calls
4. **MIGRATE** to v2.0.0 when available

## Secure Alternatives

### Option 1: Local-Only Verification
```typescript
// Run verification locally, never send to external API
const verifyLocally = (decision: TradingDecision): VerificationResult => {
  // Implement verification logic within your agent
  return performLocalVerification(decision);
};
```

### Option 2: Post-Trade Auditing
```typescript
// Only send completed trades for compliance
const auditCompletedTrade = async (executedTrade: ExecutedTrade) => {
  // Safe to send after execution
  await trustWrapper.auditTrade(executedTrade);
};
```

### Option 3: Zero-Knowledge Proofs (Coming in v2.0.0)
```typescript
// Verify without revealing details
const zkProof = await generateTradingProof(decision);
const verified = await trustWrapper.verifyProof(zkProof);
```
